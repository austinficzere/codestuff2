This repository contains a frogger game.

To compile the game, type make in the correct directory where the files are located.

Then to run the game, type ./myProg in the correct directory and the game will start.

Also, to see the game, make sure to press ctrl + alt + f1 in the terminal to open the correct terminal to be able to see the game.

To make the river stage easier, the controller only takes input from single presses. So holding down a button will only move you one space in the 
desired direction. To move multiple spaces, you need to hit the button multiple times.

The value packs are as follows: Coin -> Adds 10 to score
                                Boots -> Adds 10 steps to moves left
                                Clock -> Adds 10 seconds to time
                                Heart -> Adds 1 life to lives
